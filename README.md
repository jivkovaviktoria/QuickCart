# QuickCart

QuickCart is a ReactJS-based Single Page Application, developed as a final project for the ReactJS course at AdvanceAcademy. This application is designed to interact with a products api, offering CRUD functionalities.

## Project Task

### Overview
Create a Single Page Application using React, which will perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through requests to different pages.

### Specific Requirements
- **Utilize API**: The application must make use of the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products). This API offers functionalities essential for product management in an e-commerce setting.
- **Product Operations**:
  - **Listing Products**: Display a list of products with selected information such as title, price, brand, thumbnail, stock, and discount percentage.
  - **Searching for Products**: Implement a search feature on the product listing page, allowing users to input a search query. Upon searching, users should be taken to a page displaying all matching products.
  - **Retrieving a Single Product**: Provide detailed information about a specific product.
  - **Creating a Product**: Enable users to add new products to the listing.
  - **Updating a Product**: Allow modifications to existing products.
  - **Deleting a Product**: Implement functionality for removing products from the listing.

### Pages to Implement
1. **Product Listing Page**: A primary page displaying a list of products.
2. **Search Results Page**: Show search results with an option to view more details about each product.
3. **Product Detail Page**: Detailed view of a single product, with options to edit or delete the product.
4. **Create Product Page**: Interface for adding new products.
5. **Edit Product Page**: Facilitates editing of existing products.

### Additional Features
- Implement a custom hook for calculating the current price of a product (considering the price and discount percentage).
- Style the application according to your preference, using React CSS modules or any other styling method of your choice.
- Optionally, use Redux for managing the global state of the application.
